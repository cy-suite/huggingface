# Qwen2.5-VL

[Qwen2.5-VL](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.13923) is a multimodal vision-language model, available in 3B, 7B, and 72B parameters, pretrained on 4.1T tokens. The model introduces window attention in the ViT encoder to accelerate training and inference, dynamic FPS sampling on the spatial and temporal dimensions for better video understanding across different sampling rates, and an upgraded MRoPE (multi-resolutional rotary positional encoding) mechanism to better capture and learn temporal dynamics.


You can find all the original Qwen2.5-VL checkpoints under the [Qwen2.5-VL](https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen25-vl-6795ffac22b334a837c0f9a5) collection.

> Click on the Qwen2.5-VL models in the right sidebar for more examples of how to apply Qwen2.5-VL to different vision and language tasks.

The example below demonstrates how to generate text based on an image with [`Pipeline`] or the [`AutoModel`] class.

from transformers import pipeline
pipe = pipeline(
    task="image-text-to-text",
    model="Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct",
    device="cuda",
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16

    device_map="auto",
    attn_implementation="sdpa"
)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct")
messages = [
    {
        "role":"user",
        "content":[
            {

                "url": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggingface/documentation-images/resolve/main/pipeline-cat-chonk.jpeg"

### Notes

- Use Qwen2.5-VL for video inputs by setting `"type": "video"` as shown below.
- Use Qwen2.5-VL for a mixed batch of inputs (images, videos, text) as show below.
- Use the `min_pixels` and `max_pixels` parameters in [`AutoProcessor`] to set the resolution. Higher resolution can require more compute whereas reducing the resolution can save memory.
- Add labels when handling multiple images or videos for better reference as shown below.

#### Image Resolution trade-off

The model supports a wide range of resolution inputs. By default, it uses the native resolution for input, but higher resolutions can enhance performance at the cost of more computation. Users can set the minimum and maximum number of pixels to achieve an optimal configuration for their needs.

```python
min_pixels = 224*224
max_pixels = 2048*2048
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct", min_pixels=min_pixels, max_pixels=max_pixels)
```

In case of limited GPU RAM, one can reduce the resolution as follows:

```python
min_pixels = 256*28*28
max_pixels = 1024*28*28 
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct", min_pixels=min_pixels, max_pixels=max_pixels)
```
This ensures each image gets encoded using a number between 256-1024 tokens. The 28 comes from the fact that the model uses a patch size of 14 and a temporal patch size of 2 (14 x 2 = 28).

#### Multiple Image Inputs

By default, images and video content are directly included in the conversation. When handling multiple images, it's helpful to add labels to the images and videos for better reference. Users can control this behavior with the following settings:

```python
import torch
from transformers import Qwen2_5_VLForConditionalGeneration, AutoProcessor

model = Qwen2_5_VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct",
    torch_dtype=torch.float16,
    device_map="auto",
    attn_implementation="sdpa"
)
processor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct")
conversation = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "image"}, 
            {"type": "text", "text": "Hello, how are you?"}
        ]
    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking. How can I assist you today?"
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": [
            {"type": "text", "text": "Can you describe these images and video?"}, 
            {"type": "image"}, 
            {"type": "image"}, 
            {"type": "video"}, 
            {"type": "text", "text": "These are from my vacation."}
        ]
    },
    {
        "role": "assistant",
        "content": "I'd be happy to describe the images and video for you. Could you please provide more context about your vacation?"
    },
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "It was a trip to the mountains. Can you see the details in the images and video?"
    }
]

# default:
prompt_without_id = processor.apply_chat_template(conversation, add_generation_prompt=True)
# Excepted output: '<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n<|vision_start|><|image_pad|><|vision_end|>Hello, how are you?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI'm doing well, thank you for asking.

# add ids
prompt_with_id = processor.apply_chat_template(conversation, add_generation_prompt=True, add_vision_id=True)
# Excepted output: '<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful assistant.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nPicture 1: <|vision_start|><|image_pad|><|vision_end|>Hello, how are you?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nI'm doing well, thank you for asking.

#### Flash-Attention 2 to speed up generation

First, make sure to install the latest version of Flash Attention 2:

```bash
pip install -U flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

Also, you should have hardware that is compatible with FlashAttention 2. Read more about it in the official documentation of the [flash attention repository](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention). FlashAttention-2 can only be used when a model is loaded in `torch.float16` or `torch.bfloat16`.

To load and run a model using FlashAttention-2, add `attn_implementation="flash_attention_2"` when loading the model:

```python
from transformers import Qwen2_5_VLForConditionalGeneration

model = Qwen2_5_VLForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained(
    "Qwen/Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct", 
    torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, 
    attn_implementation="flash_attention_2",
)
```
